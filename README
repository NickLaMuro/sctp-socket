## Description

A Ruby interface for SCTP sockets.

## Prerequisites

You will need the sctp development headers installed.

## About SCTP

The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a message oriented, reliable
transport protocol with direct support for multihoming that runs on top of ip,
and supports both v4 and v6 versions.

Like TCP, SCTP provides reliable, connection oriented data delivery with
congestion control. Unlike TCP, SCTP also provides message boundary preservation,
ordered and unordered message delivery, multi-streaming and multi-homing.

Detection of data corruption, loss of data and duplication of data is achieved
by using checksums and sequence numbers. A selective retransmission mechanism
is applied to correct loss or corruption of data.

## Example

# sample_server.rb
require 'sctp/socket'

begin
  port = 62324
  socket = SCTP::Socket.new
  socket.bindx(['10.0.5.4', '10.0.6.4'], port)
  socket.set_initmsg(:output_streams => 5, :input_streams => 5, :max_attempts => 4)
  socket.subscribe(:data_io => true)
  socket.listen

  while true
    data = socket.recvmsgx
    puts data
    sleep 1
  end
ensure
  socket.close
end
